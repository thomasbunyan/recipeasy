# Recipeasy
Recipeasy is a web application which aims to provide users with a unique recipe discovery and sharing service. No longer will ambitious chefs be faced with endless cutouts from magazines and vague lists of URLs pointing to poorly written and disorganised recipes. Now a single (widely accessible) application takes away from the deterring strain, to offer a personalised and modern cooking experience. It is built following the MEAN stack design, featuring Angular for the front and Node for the back.

The home page is curated to provide the user with a custom and tailored experience. From any page a search can be performed for a recipe or cookbook. Promoted recipes and cookbooks will appear on this page, aimed directly at the users.
